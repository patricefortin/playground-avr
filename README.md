# playground-avr
Small weekend projects on avr programming (Atmega328). Many pieces of code are copied/inspired from the excellent book "Make: AVR Programming" by Elliot Williams. I highly recommand this book, especially if you have done some Arduino programming and want to go the next level of understanding. See https://github.com/hexagon5un/AVR-Programming
